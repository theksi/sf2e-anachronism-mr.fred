This spell was developed by the Corpse Fleet to target living mystics and envoys who might heal or coordinate the actions of living enemies standing against their dread fleets. How badly this debilitates the target depends on the result of its saving throw.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} until the end of its next turn, but only for purposes of targeting their allies with beneficial effects or abilities.</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature treats all of its allies as though they were undetected for purposes of targeting their allies with beneficial effects, abilities, or tactical movement. If the creature succeeds at the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ] action against this spell's save DC, they can treat their allies as hidden for the duration of the spell.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature cannot attempt to use the Seek action to find their allies while this spell is sustained.</p>"
