If the target creature would receive any form of healing while under the effects of this spell, they afterward take damage from <em>deadly vitality</em>, potentially canceling out any healing they might have just received. This damage is dependent on the results of the creature's saving throw, made when the spell is first cast.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes an amount of void damage equal to half the amount of healing they just received (rounded down), to a maximum of 5 damage.</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes an amount of void damage equal to the amount of healing they just received, to a maximum of 10 damage.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creatures takes an amount of void damage equal to the amount of healing they just received, to a maximum of 20 damage.</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> Increase the amount of damage dealt by this spell's success condition by 5, its failure condition by 10, and its critical failure condition by 20.</p>"
