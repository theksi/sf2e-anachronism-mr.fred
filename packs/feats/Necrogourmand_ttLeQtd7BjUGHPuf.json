This gives you a +1 status bonus on Deception checks to appear as a non-undead creature. You can also now receive healing from items with the vitality trait that are eaten, ingested, absorbed, or injected (such as serums or oils), but you only receive half the normal amount of healing (rounded up).</p>",
