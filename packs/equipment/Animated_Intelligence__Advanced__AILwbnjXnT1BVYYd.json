Rarely, a virtual intelligence might eventually evolve into a true artificial intelligence with self-awareness and free will, usually with the help of powerful magic or a miracle.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activateâ€”Autoattack</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> (concentrate, manipulate)</p><p><strong>Effect</strong> You Release the weapon and it glides through the air, fighting on its own against the last enemy you attacked, or the nearest enemy to it if your target has been defeated. At the end of your turn each round, the weapon can Fly up to its fly Speed of 60 feet, and then can either Fly again or Strike one creature within its range or reach.</p><p>The weapon has a space of 5 feet, but it doesn't block or impede enemies attempting to move though that space. It provides but does not benefit from flanking. The animated intelligence is considered a technological creature for the purpose of effects that can target it. The weapon can't move through an enemy's space. The weapon can't use reactions, and its Fly actions don't trigger reactions.</p><p>While it's activated, the animated intelligence Strikes with an attack modifier of +32 plus its item bonus to attack rolls. It uses the weapon's normal damage but has a +0 Strength and Dexterity modifier. The weapon's abilities that automatically trigger on a hit or critical hit still function, but the weapon can't be activated or benefit from any of your abilities while animated.</p><p>Each round, when the weapon finishes using its actions, attempt a @Check[flat|dc:4]. On a failure, the activation ends. The weapon falls to the ground and can't Autoattack again for 10 minutes.</p>"
