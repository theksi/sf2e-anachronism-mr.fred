When exposed to air by breaking the container, the incense bursts into cloying, lavender-scented smoke that sticks to incorporeal creatures and stabilizes their form.</p><p><strong>Activateâ€”Break Open</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> (manipulate) <strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> Purple smoke billows out from the incense in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:5]. At the start of each round, this emanation increases by 5 feet (to a maximum of 30 feet). The creature who activated the congealer incense can drop it in a space as a free action, or can continue to carry it with them in 1 hand, thus moving the center of the emanation on that creature's turn. Any incorporeal creature who enters this area or begins their turn inside of it must attempt a @Check[fortitude|dc:34] save.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> Treat the incorporeal creature's resistances as 4 lower.</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but the creature loses all immunity to precision damage and treats its resistances as 8 lower.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 1}.</p>"
